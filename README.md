MAC OPEN PANTRY APP is an app to facilitate the organization of Mac Open Pantry

ABOUT:
As students in a Software Development Course in the Computer Science Department, we recognized the need for automation of the pantry's inventory. Prior to this app, students were required to fill out a paper form about their visit. The app provides a backend database for organizing. 
The Macalester College Open Pantry is located in the bottom floor of the Ruth Stricker Dayton Campus Center.
Anyone is welcome to visit and take what they need.

USING THE WEB APP:
Please open this web app when you visit the pantry. Click the items that you are taking and submit as you leave.
If you cannot find an item or wish to request a specific item that you cannot find - please fill out the 'Exit Survey' which will be available to you upon submitting your 'bag.'
